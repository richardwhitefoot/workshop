# Istio

> Istio is a service mesh that provides an additional way to connect, manage and secure microservices. 

Because of lack of time, we will not be able to implement the Istio functionality. If you'd like to learn more, there is an Istio workshop [here](https://github.com/IBM/istio101) you can follow.
